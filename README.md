# OCR Project list

1. Simple Text Extraction
Objective: Start with the basics by creating an application that extracts text from various image files (e.g., JPEG, PNG) and displays or saves it.
Challenge Level: Beginner
Skills Learned: Basic Tesseract usage, image preprocessing for OCR.

2. Document Scanner and OCR
Objective: Build a document scanner that can take pictures of documents, correct the perspective, and then use OCR to extract text.
Challenge Level: Intermediate
Skills Learned: Image processing, perspective correction, text extraction from complex layouts.

3. Business Card Reader
Objective: Create an application that can scan business cards, extract contact information (name, phone, email), and automatically populate a contacts database.
Challenge Level: Intermediate
Skills Learned: Text extraction, pattern recognition for email and phone numbers, data organization.

4. Automated Invoice Processing
Objective: Develop a system that scans invoices, extracts key information (e.g., vendor name, total amount, due date), and inputs the data into an accounting system.
Challenge Level: Advanced
Skills Learned: Complex text extraction, information categorization, integration with databases or accounting software.

5. Handwritten Text Recognition
Objective: Work on recognizing handwritten notes. This is significantly more challenging due to the variability in handwriting.
Challenge Level: Advanced
Skills Learned: Handwriting OCR, advanced image preprocessing, neural network fine-tuning for better accuracy.

6. Real-Time OCR Application
Objective: Build a real-time OCR application that can extract text from the camera feed in real-time.
Challenge Level: Advanced
Skills Learned: Real-time image processing, optimizing OCR for speed, integrating OCR with mobile or web applications.

7. Multilingual OCR System
Objective: Create an OCR system that supports multiple languages, allowing users to extract text from images in various languages.
Challenge Level: Intermediate to Advanced
Skills Learned: Working with non-Latin scripts, language detection, Tesseract's language models.

8. License Plate Recognition System
Objective: Develop a system that can identify and read vehicle license plates from images or video feeds.
Challenge Level: Advanced
Skills Learned: Image segmentation, pattern recognition, working with real-time video feeds.

9. PDF Text Extractor
Objective: Build a tool that extracts text from PDF files, including those with embedded images, using OCR to convert image-based text into editable formats.
Challenge Level: Intermediate
Skills Learned: PDF manipulation, combining OCR with text extraction from PDFs.

10. Custom OCR Model Training
Objective: Enhance Tesseract's accuracy on specific fonts or styles by training a custom OCR model on a curated dataset.
Challenge Level: Advanced
Skills Learned: Machine learning, dataset preparation, Tesseract model training.
