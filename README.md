# OCR Project Ideas

## 1. Simple Text Extraction
- **Objective**: Create an application that extracts text from various image files (e.g., JPEG, PNG) and displays or saves it.
- **Challenge Level**: Beginner
- **Skills Learned**: 
  - Basic Tesseract usage
  - Image preprocessing for OCR

## 2. Document Scanner and OCR
- **Objective**: Build a document scanner that corrects the perspective of pictures of documents and uses OCR to extract text.
- **Challenge Level**: Intermediate
- **Skills Learned**: 
  - Image processing
  - Perspective correction
  - Text extraction from complex layouts

## 3. Business Card Reader
- **Objective**: Scan business cards to extract contact information (name, phone, email) and populate a contacts database automatically.
- **Challenge Level**: Intermediate
- **Skills Learned**: 
  - Text extraction
  - Pattern recognition for email and phone numbers
  - Data organization

## 4. Automated Invoice Processing
- **Objective**: Develop a system to scan invoices, extract key information (vendor name, total amount, due date), and input data into an accounting system.
- **Challenge Level**: Advanced
- **Skills Learned**: 
  - Complex text extraction
  - Information categorization
  - Integration with databases or accounting software

## 5. Handwritten Text Recognition
- **Objective**: Recognize handwritten notes, which varies significantly in style.
- **Challenge Level**: Advanced
- **Skills Learned**: 
  - Handwriting OCR
